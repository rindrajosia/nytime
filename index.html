               <p class="text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                 with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                 venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
              </p>

              <p class="text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
                 in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                 A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with
                 a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of
                 light for a prodigiously violent instant.
              </p class="text">

              <p class="text">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
              </p>

              <p class="text">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

              <p class="text">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
                fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when
                it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence
                 of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

              <p class="text">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,

              <p class="text">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.

              <p class="text">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with

         <h1>The Theory of Inflation</h1>
         <p class="summary-text">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
           which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the
           instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

              <p><span>THE UNIVERSE</span> is just under 14 billion years old.
                From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
                sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
                But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe
                has an even temperature.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p><span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled
                the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has
                not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
               <p><span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one
                direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                temperature and how much it has cooled.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
               <p><span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction.
                 You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
                 Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p><span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold.
                But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot,
                all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p><span>INFLATION</span>   solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang,
                the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
                Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p><span>FLUCTUATION</span>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in
                  swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
                 background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p><span>EXPANSION</span>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
                faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
                That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
